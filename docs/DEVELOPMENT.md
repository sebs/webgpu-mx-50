# Development

How to run, test, and build web-mx-50. Phase 0 (skeleton) — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20 (developed on 22.x).
- A WebGPU-capable browser to view the app: Chrome/Edge 113+, Safari 18+, or Firefox
  with WebGPU enabled (ADR-0002). No WebGPU → the app shows a graceful capability
  message instead of a blank canvas.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the app (dev)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs `banira dev` (ADR-0003): watches `src/`, serves the project root at
<http://127.0.0.1:8080> with live reload, and transpiles TypeScript on the fly (`--ts`,
so `./foo.js` imports resolve to `foo.ts` — no build step). Open the URL in a WebGPU
browser: you should see SMPTE-style colour bars with a moving sweep line (proof the
render loop and the source → signal-graph → present chain are live).

## Test

```bash
npm test           # typecheck + unit + features + golden (the full gate)

npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run test:unit    # node:test — pure engine/domain logic (clock, store, reducer, bindings, graph)
npm run test:features# cucumber-js — the ./features specs against the headless engine
npm run test:golden  # golden-image/SSIM scaffolding; SKIPS where no WebGPU adapter (ADR-0016)
```

The Gherkin layer (ADR-0016) executes the real `.feature` files in
[`../features`](../features). Phase 0 scopes the cucumber run to the first Rule of
`inputs-and-devices.feature` ("one input bound"); the remaining rules await later
phases (see `test/cucumber.mjs`). Unit tests run TypeScript directly via `tsx`.

## Build (no-bundler production output)

```bash
npm run build      # banira compile src/main.ts --output dist
```

Emits ES modules to `dist/` (banira follows the import graph from `main.ts`). There is
no bundler by design (ADR-0003); bare imports resolve via import maps. A
bundling/minification pass is a deferred, additive step.

## Status (Phase 2)

Implemented and rendering: **two buses** each selecting Source 1-4 or the Matte (ADR-0006
substitution), **Program Out** A/B/EFFECT routing, **Mix** + **NAM** transitions, the
**Matte generator**, and the full **compositional wipe engine** — 7 families × 4 variants,
Compression/Slide/Multi/Pairing/Blinds modifiers, Border/Soft edges, One-Way/Reverse
direction, Square Aspect, the numbering oracle (001 plain, +128 reversed) and Blinds
legality fallback — driven by the Mix/Wipe lever, plus the Web Component control strip.
Open the app, pick WIPE, choose a family, and drag the lever.

Still **pass-through** (later phases): colour correction, digital effects + frame memory
(Phase 3), luminance/chroma keys + DSK (Phase 4), fade (Phase 6), audio (Phase 5).

Known deferrals: **golden-image pixel tests** (no headless-WebGPU runner in this
environment); **Compression/Slide/Blinds are domain-modelled but not yet in the wipe
shader** (it renders base families + edges + direction + aspect + Multi/Pairing); the
underivable Pattern-Table parts stay `@wip`; and **real browser-input binding**
(camera/video/image live textures) is still open from Phase 1. See the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

The domain is verified headlessly: **60 `node:test` units** and **176 Gherkin scenarios
(1237 steps)** across source-selection, program-output, transition-mix-nam,
matte-generator, wipe-patterns, and wipe-edge-and-direction.
